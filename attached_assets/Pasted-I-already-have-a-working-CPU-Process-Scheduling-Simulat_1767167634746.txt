I already have a working CPU Process Scheduling Simulator built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Currently implemented and WORKING:
- Process input UI (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority)
- Algorithm selection (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin)
- Scheduling logic
- Gantt Chart visualization
- Detailed metrics table (CT, TAT, WT, RT)
- Average Waiting, Turnaround, and Response Time

I now want to EXTEND the existing project by ADDING ONLY the features listed below.
DO NOT remove or break existing functionality.

--------------------------------------------------
FEATURES TO ADD (FINAL CONFIRMED LIST)
--------------------------------------------------

1. CPU Idle Time Handling
- Detect time gaps when no process is ready
- Insert explicit "IDLE" blocks in the Gantt chart
- Calculate and store total CPU idle time
- Show idle blocks with a distinct color and label

2. Context Switch Tracking
- Count context switches
- Increment count whenever CPU switches from one process to another
- Display context switch count in summary dashboard
- Optionally mark context switch points in Gantt chart

3. Ready Queue Visualization
- Add a small panel to show the Ready Queue
- Update it dynamically as time progresses
- Display queue contents like: [P2, P4, P5]

4. Algorithm Explanation Box
- Show a short explanation for the selected scheduling algorithm
- Include:
  - How it works
  - Preemptive or non-preemptive nature
  - When it is best used
- Update explanation dynamically on algorithm change

5. Summary Dashboard
Create a dashboard section displaying:
- Total CPU Time
- Total CPU Idle Time
- CPU Utilization (%)
- Number of Context Switches
- Algorithm Efficiency Score (based on Avg WT, Avg TAT, Utilization)

6. Algorithm Comparison Mode
- Add a "Compare Algorithms" button
- Run FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin on the SAME input
- Display a comparison table with:
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
  - Context Switches
- Highlight the best-performing algorithm

7. Execution Logs Panel
- Display time-based logs such as:
  - "Time 2: P3 arrived"
  - "Time 4: P2 preempted P1"
  - "Time 10: P1 completed"
- Append logs dynamically during simulation

8. Timeline Replay Slider
- Add a slider to replay the simulation step-by-step
- Slider movement should update:
  - Current running process
  - Ready queue
  - Highlighted Gantt chart block

9. UI Enhancements
- Reset / Reload simulation button
- Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle (CSS-based)
- Proper input validation messages
- Clean and professional layout

--------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION RULES
--------------------------------------------------
- Use ONLY HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- No backend, no database, no frameworks
- Extend existing files (do not rewrite)
- Add code incrementally and safely
- Comment all new logic clearly
- Keep code beginner-friendly and readable

--------------------------------------------------
START BY:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Identifying existing functions
2. Extending logic for idle time and context switch tracking
3. Adding new HTML sections for:
   - Dashboard
   - Ready Queue
   - Logs
   - Comparison
4. Ensuring existing simulation still works

Generate changes step by step.
DO NOT overwrite working code.
