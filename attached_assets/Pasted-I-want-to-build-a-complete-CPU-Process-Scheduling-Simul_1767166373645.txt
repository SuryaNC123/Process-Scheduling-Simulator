I want to build a complete CPU Process Scheduling Simulator as a beginner-friendly but academically strong BTech project.

Project type:
- Software-only simulation project (no hardware, no backend server)
- Core Computer Science project based on Operating Systems and Algorithms
- Technologies to use: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript only

Project requirements:

1. User Interface (Input Area)
- Form to enter number of processes
- Dynamic table to input:
  - Process ID (P1, P2, ...)
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority (for Priority Scheduling)
- Input field for Time Quantum (only for Round Robin)
- Dropdown to select scheduling algorithm:
  - FCFS
  - SJF (Non-Preemptive)
  - SJF (Preemptive)
  - Priority (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority (Preemptive)
  - Round Robin
- Buttons:
  - Simulate
  - Reset
- Proper input validation with error messages

2. Scheduling Algorithms (Core Logic in JavaScript)
Implement the following algorithms accurately:
- FCFS
- SJF Non-Preemptive
- SJF Preemptive
- Priority Non-Preemptive
- Priority Preemptive
- Round Robin

The logic should:
- Maintain a ready queue
- Handle arrival time correctly
- Handle CPU idle time
- Handle preemption
- Count context switches
- Simulate time unit by unit

3. Gantt Chart Visualization
- Display a visual Gantt chart after simulation
- Each process block should be color-coded
- Show start and end time labels
- Show CPU idle blocks clearly
- Show context switch points visually

4. Process Result Table
Display a table with:
- PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority
- Completion Time (CT)
- Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Waiting Time (WT)
- Response Time (RT)
- Also calculate:
  - Average WT
  - Average TAT
  - Average RT

5. Ready Queue Visualization
- Display current ready queue during simulation
- Update it as time progresses

6. Algorithm Explanation Box
- Show a short explanation of the selected scheduling algorithm on the UI

7. Summary Dashboard
Display:
- Total CPU time
- CPU idle time
- CPU utilization (%)
- Number of context switches
- Algorithm efficiency score

8. Algorithm Comparison Mode
- Compare FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin for the same input
- Show comparison table with:
  - Average WT
  - Average TAT
  - CPU utilization
  - Context switches
- Highlight best-performing algorithm

9. Performance Charts
- Bar chart comparing:
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
- Pie chart showing CPU Busy Time vs Idle Time

10. Extra Features
- Detailed execution logs (time-based events)
- Timeline slider to replay simulation
- Reset simulation functionality
- Dark mode / light mode toggle
- Option to export results (CSV or PDF if possible)

Project structure:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- Separate JS functions for each scheduling algorithm
- Clean, commented, readable code
- Beginner-friendly structure

Important notes:
- Do NOT use React, backend frameworks, or databases
- Everything should run in the browser
- Focus on clarity, correctness, and visualization
- This project is for BTech evaluation and viva

Start by generating:
1) Basic folder structure
2) index.html skeleton with input form and placeholders
3) style.css basic layout
4) script.js with empty function stubs for algorithms
